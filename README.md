	<p><b>My name is Krish and I want to make websites. I am really interested in website creating and would wish to learn more as it is my dream, <br>I like animals. My favorite animal are birds. They're really intelligent especially crows and parrots. I like <mark style="color: powderblue"> powder blue </mark> and <mark style="color: pink">baby pink</mark>, they would have to be my favorite colours.</b></p>
       
       <p><b>I don't like school but it can be alright. I like my class because they are funny and fun. I just wish we wouldn't have to learn french. Their reason being is that we can get higher grades because we can think differently. I already know Bangla but there's more reasons like finding your soulmate. I guess that's a valid reason but I still can't be asked to do it. I like computer studying tho. History is interesting and science is alright. Science isn't my favorite subject though but it's good.</b></p>

       <p><b>I have a pet parakeet named Sky. When I first had him I felt like stressed because I didn't know what to do. I let it get used to its environment and started introducing him to my hand. He's used to my hand now and he keeps flying around the room. I love my bird and its my bestest friend in the world!</b></p>

       <p><b>I also want to learn how to make games using Lua. I have knowledge of Lua in ROBLOX and It's really easy to use. The basics are just changing properties. Well, that's what I think at least. Coding can be really interesting once you know it, aha!</b></p>

       <p><b>Well, it's clearly obvious that I live in Britain but actually, my mother was pregnant at India. So I'm half Indian and hald British. I get alot of people asking me if I know "Indian". I usually tell them that Indian isn't a language, well that's what I think.</b></p>

       <p><b>My favorite games are ROBLOX and Minecraft. You get to express your games and share with other people. It's honestly amazing that you get </b></p>
