	<h1>What is ransomware?</h1>
	<p>Ransomware is a type of malicicious software that encrypts your data or locks out your device until you pay. <br> They usually tell you to pay 2 bitcoins which is more then one thousand dollars! </p>


	<h2>Locker ransomware and crypto ransomware</h2>
	<p>First, let's talk about locker ransomware. Locker ransomware locks you out forcing you to pay so you can gain control over your device. <br> Crypto ransomware encrypts your confidential and important files. They will threaten to destroy your files unless you pay a fee.</p>

	<h1>How can ransomware get to you?</h1>
	<p>The three main ways ransomware can get to you is.. <br>Spam Emails <br> Spear phishing <br> Water hole attacks <br> Scareware tactics are also another way to spread ransomware by creating fake software or messages. They looks believable but demands you pay to get your device back.</p>

	<h1>How can you fight against a ransomware?</h1>
	<p>Well you need to recognise if it's safe or not. Don't open any suspicious emails and links. Here's a tip, if you look at a link and it has "https", then it's safe because the s in htpps means secured. If it doesn't have a s then don't click on it. Be sure to  back up your device and always use up-to-date internet software with anti-ransomware technologies. Never pay a ransom as it encourages the cyber criminal and continue doing it.</p>
